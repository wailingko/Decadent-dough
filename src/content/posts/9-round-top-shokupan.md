We have been making shokupans weekly over the last period. This weekend, I let my dough proof for too long and I couldn't get the lid onto the loaf pan so made a round-topped loaf instead. According to Namiko Chen from
<a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-milk-bread-shokupan/" target="_blank"> recipe</a> "Just One Cookbook":

> The round-topped loaf is baked without a lid, which allows it to stretch upward and have a light and soft texture. On the other hand, the flat-topped loaf is baked with a lid, so the evaporation of water is minimal; it has a moist and chewy texture.


## The Recipe

I followed the same recipe for Japanese milkbread
<a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-milk-bread-shokupan/" target="_blank"> recipe</a> on "Just One Cookbook"
with the adjustments I made for the flat-topped shokupan. The only difference was in the final rise stage.

#### The Final Rise
- I let the dough rise till the dough just touches the plastic cling film.

#### Bake
- I find that our oven gets hotter than the average temperature settings in most recipes. I set the oven temperature 10 &deg;C lower: pre-heat at 200&deg;C and bake at 190&deg;C for 28 minutes.

#### Cool
- I didn't make any changes to this step.


### Tools
Here is an overview of the tools I used for this recipe:
- Digital Kitchen Scales
- Cooking Thermometer
- Stand Mixer: I have this one [Kenwood Chef XL Elite KVL6300S](https://www.kenwoodworld.com/en/chef-xl-elite-kvl6300s/p/KVL6300S "Kenwood Chef XL Elite")
- 1.5 kin Shokupan Loaf Pan: my loaf pan is from the Asai Shoten store in Tokyo and is a non-stick loaf pan. You can find more information on this loaf pan [here](https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-loaf-pans/)
