This weekend I made "Luikse Wafels" (Waffles from Luike/Liege). As a child, we would go shopping in Belgium as we lived close to the Belgian border. As soon, as you would walk into a Belgian city, you would be greated by a smell of sweet buttery delight. If you would follow that fragrance, you would end up at a tiny stall selling "Luikse Wafels". You can tell whether it is a real Luikse Wafel when they have a light caramalized, glossy appearance and a distinctive crunch when you bite into them. It is the  <a href="https://www.bbcmaestro.com/blog/pearl-sugar" target="_blank"> pearl sugar or nib sugar</a>  that gives the waffle that light crunch. I could never only eat one and then regret instantly having devoured a second one.

## The Recipe   
Unlike American breakfast waffles which are made with a batter, the "Luikse Wafels" are made with dough.The dough needs to go through 2 rounds of rising so you will need to plan for that. The dough only requires pantry staples except for the pearl sugar. That will be the most difficult ingredient to source. I was luckly to find <a href="https://www.essentialingredient.com.au/collections/sugars/products/the-essential-ingredient-pearl-sugar" target="_blank"> Pearl Sugar from Essential Ingredient</a> a while back and instantly bought a 2kg pack when I got my hands on them. If you can't get Pearl Sugar from the stores, you could try making it yourself. I tried this recipe a long time ago, it's a good alternative.
