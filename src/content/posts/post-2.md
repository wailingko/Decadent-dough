I started baking shokupan after finding [Princess Bamboo"](https://princessbamboo.com/how-to-make-nama-shokupan/ "Princess Bamboo"), Akino Ogata, on social media. She started publishing food content because she wanted to learn English. What a way to do this. She posted about a ["Nama Shokupan"](https://princessbamboo.com/how-to-make-nama-shokupan/ "Nama Shokupan") which is a decadent treat version of a normal Shokupan, usually eaten in the weekend. Decadent because the use of cream in this recipe. This makes the bread slightly more indulgent.

> Nama Shokupan is very fluffy and moist, a little bit sweeter than the regular. Nama means raw or fresh, they recommend to eat as it is. Shokupan is our everyday food, but we need something a little bit indulging on the weekend or on a particular day.
