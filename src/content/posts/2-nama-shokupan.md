I started baking shokupan after finding Akino Ogata on social media. Akino was publishing food content on <a href="https://princessbamboo.com/about-akino/" target="_blank"> "Princess Bamboo"</a>, because she wanted to learn English. What a way to kill two birds with one stone! She posted about a <a href="https://princessbamboo.com/how-to-make-nama-shokupan/" target="_blank"> "Nama Shokupan"</a> which is a decadent treat version of a normal Shokupan, usually eaten in the weekend. Decadent because of the use of cream in this recipe. This makes the bread slightly more indulgent. It was the first real shokupan I have ever baked.

> Nama Shokupan is very fluffy and moist, a little bit sweeter than the regular. Nama means raw or fresh, they recommend to eat as it is. Shokupan is our everyday food, but we need something a little bit indulging on the weekend or on a particular day - Akino Ogata

## The Recipe
This bread uses the "Yudane" method which requires you to make a hot water roux beforehand. The purpose of the Yudane is to assist the dough to absorb more water: a higher hydration results in a fluffier and softer bread. 
Ensure that all ingredients are at room temperature before making the dough. I made the Yudane roughly 2 hours before I started making the bread to ensure it was cooled down to room temperature by the time I mixed it through the dough. 
I bought all the ingredients at my local supermarket and here are some of the ingredients I used:
- For flour, I used a <a href="https://www.lighthousebaking.com.au/breadandpizzaplainflour" target="_blank"> "high protein bread flour"</a> (11.9%) 
- I used full fat thickened cream, who does light anyway

To encourage proofing, I created a proof box by putting a measuring jug of hot water in a microwave and put the bowl of dough in there. The only adjustment I made to the recipe is that I baked my nama shokupan for 36 minutes at 170&deg;C instead of 40 minutes at 180&deg;C.
