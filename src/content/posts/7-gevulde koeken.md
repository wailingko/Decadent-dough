Amandelspijs (Almond paste) is one those fantastic sweet fillings of Dutch cookies. It's very similar to the more internationally known <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/1541134/frangipane-explained-essential-baking-ingredient#:~:text=Frangipane%20is%20a%20mixture%20of,making%20a%20simple%20cookie%20batter" target="_blank"> frangipane</a> but contains fewer ingredients. The bakers make different type of cookies with amandelspijs and today I made "Gevulde Koeken" (Filled Cookies). It's an everyday cookie that you can find at any local Dutch supermarket or a bakery. 


## The Recipe   
Before making the actual cookies, you need to make the amandelspijs a few days before. It needs to rest in the fridge to fully develop the taste. The recipe for amandelspijs is super simple: equal amounts of almond meal and sugar, egg and grated lemon peel. My go-to recipe reference is on the website of <a href="https://www.laurasbakery.nl/zelf-amandelspijs-maken/" target="_blank"> Laura's Bakery</a>.

For the actual cookie dough, I followed Rutger's recipe on  <a href="https://rutgerbakt.nl/koek-recepten/gevulde-koeken-recept/)" target="_blank"> Rutger Bakt</a>: Rutger won the very first edition of the Dutch Bake Off in 2013 on has a huge collection of baking recipes on his baking blog. He uses 50% plain flour and 50% Zeeuws bloem which is a lower protein flour used for cookies and cakes, which gives the Gevulde Koeken a more crispy bite. I used <a href="https://www.lighthousebaking.com.au/products/lighthouse-biscuit%2C-pastry-%26-cake"> target="_blank"> Lighthouse biscuit, pastry & cake flour</a> which you can buy at the local supermarket and reduced the caster sugar amount with 10 grams to make it slightly less sweet.

The Gevulde Koeken turned out delicious: crispy on the outside, soft amandelspijs on the inside. The outside tastes like a regular butter cookie. I think next time I will make the <a href="https://rutgerbakt.nl/sinterklaas-recepten/gevulde-speculaaskoeken-recept/" target="_blank"> Gevulde Speculaaskoeken</a> to give the biscuit a spiced flavour.
